Security Assessment of 2048 Game Center

The write-up security assessment of Ming Chow's coded solution to assignment 4 has been completed. 3 security
concerns have been identified, addressed, and explained, and solutions for all found exploitations have been
suggested. The format of the document is as requested per the assignment description.
Due to issues of timing and the completion of the previous assignment, the analysis was done with Ming's code
rather than the code of my partner (though he has my code to analyze).

Approximately 3-4 hours were spent on this assignment. Most of that time was spent searching for security flaws,
and about an hour total was spent writing up the report.
