README.txt for comp20-skahn private Github repository

This repository is for the submission of programming assignments and labs
for Comp 20, Web Programming, at Tufts University.

My favorite project, and the project that I am most proud of, is the MBTA
map (i.e. Assignment 3). I'm most proud of this lab because it is practical,
and required me to put in the most effort and time out of all other assignments
for this course.

I feel that this course has greatly expanded my potential as a programmer. I
feel as though, although I've learned a lot of specific ways to implement 
certain features and write applications and markup in certain languages, the
most important thing I've learned is how to learn. In other words, I've learned
how to think like a web programmer and how to become a fairly self-sufficient
web programmer. I've also learned the tools and tricks of the trade, as a
consequence of Ming's teachings. I've learned what the industry is like and
what potential employers value in a prospective employee. In short, I feel as
though my potentials and abilities have been greatly expanded.
